## Project 3

Project 3 was the first project of the CIT 281 course that introduced Node.js web server JavaScript. The first part of this project had us create four functions that used different methods of JavaScript to count and handle coin objects. Some of the methods included indexOf() and Array.reduce(). 

We were then tasked with creating a web server and HTML page with 3 different routes using fastify and the GET verb.
